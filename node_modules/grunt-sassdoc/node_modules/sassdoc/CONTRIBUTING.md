# Contributing

## How to contribute?

There are many things you can do to contribute SassDoc:

* Report a bug
* Fix a bug or implement a new feature
* Suggest a new feature
* Improve the documentation

## Asking a question

Please, do not open an issue only to ask a question; it is not the best place for this. First, make sure your question is not already answered in the [documentation](http://sassdoc.com), especially in the [Frequently Asked Questions](http://sassdoc.com/frequently-asked-questions/) section.

If it's not, you can leave your question on:

* [tlk.io/sassdoc](http://tlk.io/sassdoc)
* [#sassdoc on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/)

If you need a quick reply or don't feel really comfortable with asking on a public channel, try getting in touch with us on Twitter: [@SassDoc_](https://twitter.com/sassdoc_).

## Filling a bug

So you think you've found a bug? Likely. We're all humans after all! Before even opening an issue, you have to know how SassDoc is architectured so you can submit an issue in the accurate repository:

* [Core](https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc): API (you're here)
* [Theme](https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc-theme-light): Theme, templates and styles
* [Filter](https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc-filter): Markdown, display, groups...
* [Indexer](https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc-indexer): Data structure
* [Grunt plugin](https://github.com/sassdoc/grunt-sassdoc): Grunt integration
* [Gulp plugin](https://github.com/sassdoc/gulp-sassdoc): Gulp integration
* [Broccoli plugin](https://github.com/sassdoc/broccoli-sassdoc): Broccoli integration
* [Theme generator](https://github.com/sassdoc/generator-theme-sassdoc): Yeoman theme generator
* [Site](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc.github.io): SassDoc's site

Please give GitHub's search a try first, to make sure someone didn't already submit something similar. If what you've found seems unique, be sure to open an issue in the appropriate repository with a clear title and a description as complete as possible.

Avoid titles like "it doesn't work", "please help me", or "bug with sassdoc". It doesn't help much understanding the problem at first glance.

Similarly, be as descriptive as possible within your description. If you have a stack trace, post it. If you can make a screenshot, even better! Explain the problem and how you got there so we can reproduce it. Only then we'll be able to investigate.

## Submitting a pull request

Want to contribute? Awesome!

If it's a little something like typo, styles or wording, feel free to jump on it and submit a pull request; chances are high it will be quickly merged.

If you are thinking of something a bit more complex, be sure to talk with someone from the team before even starting coding in order to avoid any useless work.

New features or sizeable refactors should be based on the `develop` branch.

Anyway, thank you very much for contributing!
